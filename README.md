# Saxa and Luigi's Murder Mystery

Saxa and Luigi's Murder Mystery was made as a mode to counter LeoTM and how strict he is with his Murder Mystery. We do not have any intent to overthrow him, this is an entirely different thing.

This mode is 100% re-usable, even LeoTM can steal the code from here.

## Why this was made.
Me and my friends got tired of LeoTM's mode, from the OST, to the un-necessary things. We didn't make this to compete, we made this as an alternative for people who also don't like Leo's mode.

## How can I help?
If you can code, try making a pull request for something you want!
If you can do art, compose, etc. Hit me up at **@literally_mario on Discord!**

## Is there an Discord server?
Yes! https://discord.gg/J6yzyJV8Ta

You'll be pinged whenever I'm hosting the mod, you can also contribute directly, and more!
